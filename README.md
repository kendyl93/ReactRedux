# ReactRedux

# Run the app

In order to run the app follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in a root folder and run `npm install`
2. Run the app typing `npm run start`

### Selected packages installed reason:

I decided to describe in a short sentence why some packages are included in the project.

- **Husky** - needed to run pre-commit tests
- **Eslint** - to show errors/warnings in the code - rules can be modified in `.eslintrc`
- **Prettier** - to format the code - rules can be modified in `.prettierrc`

### TODO:

- Add more tests(react components, logic) and check tests coverage
- Add spinner as a ui
- Implement modal(integrate with Redux) - which adds some new elements to the lists from api
- check how to implement lazy load in react
